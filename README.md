# Wallpaper Tool (Windows)

This project was made to make my wallpaper changes way faster than going through all  
Windows 10 settings.

This project is scanning the folder that you set inside the `config.js` file.  
Then it will propose you a menu where you can choose the wallpaper you want to set.
